    <p>The medical field is growing fast as our population ages and grows at a rapid pace. Overall, jobs for physicians and surgeons are expected to increase by 13% by 2026, which is faster than the overall national average for all jobs. This list is in order of mean salary. Keep in mind that salaries and job growth projections are not exact.</p>
    <p>Professors and doctors can help guide you. They might be able to see something you’ve missed, like that you’re great with kids, or that you were passionate about vaccination or immunology. Since they're already practicing and teaching, they're an integral part in helping you learn about the different types of physicians and where you see yourself. </p>
