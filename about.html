<p>In a rare honour, the Government of India had issued a commemorative stamp in recognition of Apollo's widespread contributions, the first for a healthcare organization. In addition, a stamp was also released to mark the 15th anniversary of India's 1st successful liver transplant performed at Apollo Hospitals. More recently Apollo Hospitals was again honoured with a postal stamp for having successfully performed 20 million health checks and its pioneering efforts in encouraging preventive healthcare in the country.

Dr. Prathap C Reddy, Founder Chairman of the Apollo Hospitals Group has been conferred with the prestigious Padma Vibhushan, India's second highest civilian award.</p>
